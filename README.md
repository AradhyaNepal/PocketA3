Hello, this is my V2 of Self-Productivity app named PocketA3. You can view the V1 Digi3Map here: [Touch Me!](https://github.com/AradhyaNepal/Digi3Map)

Digi3Map was a project from where I learned Django and Flutter. 
Thanks to the project I built a career on Flutter, but I dropped Django later because I found Python (or any interpreter language) "Not my Type".

In the same way, the features of PocketA3 are not my major concern, I am doing this to learn to be a full-stack Mobile Developer.

This PocketA3 is a project from which I will learn Sprint boot, Kotlin with jetpack compose for Android development, and Swift with SwiftUI for iOS development.
I will also try random quick interesting things on the project that I find interesting on my way.

I tried this PocketA3 initially from .Net but since Java was my first programming language on my Mobile development journey, I find .Net hard to migrate.

The Gantt Chart from this project is something like this:
May, Jun, July, Aug : 
  - Learning Spring Boot.
  - Learning Postgress and Mongo
  - Learning very basic deployment concepts.
  - Consuming the API from Flutter to market the API with some real utility, and also to know whether the API is working or not.

Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec:
 - My backend is ready, and it's integrated into Flutter which means its working properly too.
 - I have learned adequate backend, and I am also ready to use this knowledge in the software industry market.
 - Now I will learn Kotlin with jetpack compose, and integrate the API.
 - While integrating, I also have to maintain the backend too, and add new features. Basically, it's in the maintenance phase.
 - Since I am already doing Flutter on office projects too, from this phase I will "deprecate" Flutter on all of my practice projects.
   It might sound controversial but, I must expand myself to the mobile stack in till future I wanna be a mobile developer, and I cannot depend on my career on just Flutter.
   Flutter is my first love to build my career, but I need backup.

Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr:
  - Till this time I hope Apple launches Mac Mini with M3 or with M4. If yes I will buy it, if not, I will buy a Mac Mini base model but with the latest M chip recently launched.
  - I already have an iPhone.
  - With the above device, I got the Sprint boot backend, the backend is consumed for Android (Forget about Flutter, it's deprecated.) It's not time to consume the backend for IOS.
  - I will now learn Swift UI for IOS and consume the API for the IOS too.
  - Obviously, the backend and the Native Android remain in the maintenance phase.

On May 1 I will Archive this project, and this project always remains "public".
And will decide whether I will create a separate private repo and move this project to production, or drop the project since the initial aim was only learning, not about creating something for production.
