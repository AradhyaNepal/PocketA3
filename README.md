Hello, this is my V2 of Self-Productivity app named PocketA3. You can view the V1 Digi3Map here: [Touch Me!](https://github.com/AradhyaNepal/Digi3Map)

Digi3Map was a project from where I learned Django and Flutter. 
Thanks to the project I built a career on Flutter, but I dropped Django later because I found Python (or any interpreter language) "Not my Type".

In the same way, the features of PocketA3 are not my major concern, I am doing this to learn to be a full-stack Mobile/Web Developer.

This PocketA3 is a project from which I will learn:
1) Sprint boot
2) React inside Flutter for android app
3) Finally Swift with SwiftUI for iOS development.

This project deadline is 2025 July 1. Where first 9 month is Spring boot and react then other 3 month is IOS.
