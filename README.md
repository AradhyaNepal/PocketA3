Hello, this is my V2 of Self-Productivity app named PocketA3. You can view the V1 Digi3Map here: [Touch Me!](https://github.com/AradhyaNepal/Digi3Map)

Digi3Map was a project from where I learned Django and Flutter. 
Thanks to the project I built a career on Flutter, but I dropped Django later because I found Python (or any interpreter language) "Not my Type".

In the same way, the features of PocketA3 are not my major concern, I am doing this to learn to be a full-stack Mobile/Web Developer.

This PocketA3 is a project from which I will learn:
1) Sprint boot for backend
2) React for marketing dynamic website and for admin panel
3) Flutter only for UI calling method channel.
4) Native Android and Native IOS for method channel, functionality. I will modify preexisting plugins.

This project deadline is 2025 July 1. But if I get engaged in something else which pays me money, I can extend the deadline.
