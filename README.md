<h3> 1-year project. May 1 2024 to May 1, 2025, with the aim to learn the tech stack required to be a full-stack Stack Mobile Developer with Flutter, Spring and Swift on tech stack. </h3>

Hello, this is my V2 of Self-Productivity app named PocketA3. You can view the V1 Digi3Map here: [Touch Me!](https://github.com/AradhyaNepal/Digi3Map)

Digi3Map was a project from where I learned Django and Flutter. 
Thanks to the project I built a career on Flutter, but I dropped Django later because I found Python (or any interpreter language) "Not my Type".

In the same way, the features of PocketA3 are not my major concern, I am doing this to learn to be a full-stack Mobile Developer.

This PocketA3 is a project from which I will learn Sprint boot, and Swift with SwiftUI for iOS development.
I will also try random quick interesting things on the project that I find interesting on my way.

I tried this PocketA3 initially from .Net but since Java was my first programming language on my Mobile development journey, I find .Net hard to migrate.

The Gantt Chart from this project is something like this:

May 1 2024, Jun, July, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec: 
  - Learning Spring Boot.
  - Learning Postgress and Mongo
  - Create fully functional backend of my project.

Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr:
  - Till this time I hope Apple launches Mac Mini with M3 or with M4. If yes I will buy it, if not, I will buy a Macbook Air base model but with the latest M chip recently launched.
  - I already have an iPhone, if it is lost or damaged I will buy it second-hand.
  - With the above device, I got the Sprint boot backend, It's time to consume the backend for IOS.
  - I will now learn Swift UI for IOS and consume the API for the IOS too.
  - With the above device I will also learn the Mac environment, simultaneously carrying a Linux laptop as my primary powerful device.


In this way, I had once done Native android, then switched to Flutter but as a backup for by mobile development dream learned IOS, yet to not stucked in just mobile, learned backend spring boot.
