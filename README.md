Hello, this is my V2 of Self-Productivity app named PocketA3. You can view the V1 Digi3Map here: [Touch Me!](https://github.com/AradhyaNepal/Digi3Map)

Digi3Map was a project from where I learned Django and Flutter. 
Thanks to the project I built a career on Flutter, but I dropped Django later because I found Python (or any interpreter language) "Not my Type".

In the same way, the features of PocketA3 are not my major concern, I am doing this to learn to be a full-stack Mobile Developer.

This PocketA3 is a project from which I will learn Sprint boot, Kotlin with jetpack compose for Android development, and Swift with SwiftUI for iOS development.
I will also try random quick interesting things on the project that I find interesting on my way.

I tried this PocketA3 initially from .Net but since Java was my first programming language on my Mobile development journey, I find .Net hard to migrate.

The Gantt Chart from this project is something like this:
May, Jun, July, Aug : 
  - Learning Spring Boot.
  - Learning Postgress and Mongo
  - Learning very basic deployment concepts.
  - Consuming the API from Flutter to market the API with some real utility, and also to know whether the API is working or not.

Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec:
